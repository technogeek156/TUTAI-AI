This repository is devoted to the growing and development of TUTAI, or the Turing Test Artificial Intelligence. Honestly I don't care how you pronounce it, just please follow the licence and give credit back to me(technogeek156). I can be contacted through github, at stack overflow, or at my email(technogeek156@gmail.com). This program works by recording new phrases to a file named the phrase. The responce for the phrase is within the .txt file. DO NOT PUT THESE FILES ONTO YOUR DESKTOP AND TALK WITH THE PROGRAM FOR AN EXTENDED TIME. YOUR DESKTOP WILL BE SPAMMED. I do not promote the destruction of any files you generate. In my opinion, this is like destroying a person's memories. I will not discuss the ethics of this and please do not start a flamewar about them. This repository is devoted to the growing and development of TUTAI, or the Turing Test Artificial Intelligence.
